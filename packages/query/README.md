# Overview

This package is designed to provide common abstractions for data storage and
representations that are agnostic to the underlying provider. The providers
themselves can be swapped in and out with minimal changes to allow flexibility
during the design and growth of your application. It is designed to also
maintain type awareness as you write queries so what you see is what you get!
