# Overview

Granada is a framework developed in Typescript and NodeJS for managing
applications of any size and scale! I've spent the past few decades working
with a lot of different types of applications and languages, but kept re-building
the same things which were missing in the tools I had available at each stop.
Now I want to bring some of those ideas and practices to the rest of the world
so you don't have to rebuild them yourselves. I have a lot of things that I
plan to add over time so this will be a living codebase and set of
documentation, but if there is something you'd like to see that's missing right
now, please feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:nathan@telefrek.com) or
create an [issue](https://github.com/telefrek/granada/issues) and I'll see what
I can do. Thanks and enjoy!

# Documentation

As everyone who knows me has heard, `I'm working on it but it's not available yet
lol...`
